                   "content": "The fire at the Black Spot happened in the late fall of 1930. So far as I am able to determine, that fire—the one my father barely escaped—ended the cycle of murder and disappearance which happened in the years 1929–30, just as the explosion at the Ironworks ended a cycle some twenty-five years before. It is as if a monstrous sacrifice is needed at the end of the cycle to quiet whatever terrible force it is which works here . . . to send It to sleep for another quarter-century or so. But if such a sacrifice is needed to end each cycle, it seems that some similar event is needed to set each cycle in motion. Which brings me to the Bradley Gang. Their execution took place at the three-way intersection of Canal, Main, and Kansas—not far, in fact, from the place shown in the picture which began to move for Bill and Richie one day in June of 1958—some thirteen months before the fire at the Black Spot, in October of 1929 . . . not long before the stock-market crash. As with the fire at the Black Spot, many Derry residents affect not to remember what happened that day. Or they were out of town, visiting relatives. Or they were napping that afternoon and never found out what had happened until they heard it on the radio news that night. Or they will simply look you full in the face and lie to you. The police logs for that day indicate that Chief Sullivan was not even in town (Sure I remember, Aloysius Nell told me from a chair on the sun-terrace of the Paulson Nursing Home in Bangor. That was my first year on the force, and I ought to remember. He was off in western Maine, bird-hunting. They’d been sheeted and carried off by the time he got back. Madder than a wet hen was Jim Sullivan), but a picture in a reference book on gangsters called Bloodletters and Badmen shows a grinning man standing beside the bullet-riddled corpse of Al Bradley in the morgue, and if that man is not Chief Sullivan, it is surely his twin brother."

                   "content": "'You’re too young to remember when Bobby Thomson hit his home run for the Giants in the play-off game in 1951,' Mr. Keene said. 'You wouldn’t have been but four years old. Well! They ran an article about that game in the newspaper a few years after, and it seemed like just about a million folks from New York claimed they were there in the ballpark that day.' Mr. Keene gummed his licorice whip and a little dark drool ran down from the corner of his mouth. He wiped it off fastidiously with his handkerchief. We were sitting in the office behind the drugstore, because although Norbert Keene was eighty-five and retired ten years, he still did the books for his grandson. 'Just the opposite when it comes to the Bradley Gang!' Keene exclaimed. He was smiling, but it was not a pleasant smile—it was cynical, coldly reminiscent. 'There was maybe twenty thousand people who lived in downtown Derry back then. Main Street and Canal Street had both been paved for four years, but Kansas Street was still dirt. Raised dust in the summer and turned into a boghole every March and November. They used to oil Up-Mile Hill every June and every Fourth of July the Mayor would talk about how they were going to pave Kansas Street, but it never happened until 1942. It . . . but what was I saying?''Twenty thousand people who lived right downtown,' I prompted. 'Oh. Ayuh. Well, of those twenty thousand, there’s probably half that have passed away since, maybe even more—fifty years is a long time. And people have a funny way of dying young in Derry. Perhaps it is the air. But of those left, I don’t think you’d find more than a dozen who’d say they were in town the day the Bradley Gang went to Tophet. Butch Rowden over at the meat market would fess up to it, I guess—he keeps a picture of one of the cars they had up on the wall where he cuts meat. Looking at that picture you’d hardly know it was a car. Charlotte Littlefield would tell you a thing or two, if you could get on her good side; she teaches over to the high school, and although I reckon she must not have been more than ten or twelve at the time I bet she remembers plenty. Carl Snow . . . Aubrey Stacey . . . Eben Stampnell . . . and that old geezer who paints those funny pictures and drinks all night at Wally’s—Pickman, I think his name is—they’d remember. They were all there. . . .' He trailed off vaguely, looking at the licorice whip in his hand. I thought of prodding him and decided not to. At last he said, 'Most of the others would lie about it, the way people lied and said they were there when Bobby Thomson hit his homer, that’s all I mean. But people lied about being at that ballgame because they wished they had been there. People would lie to you about being in Derry that day because they wish they hadn’t been. Do you understand me, sonny?'"

'I don’t,' I said, 'but I think I better, all the same.' 'Okay,' Mr. Keene said mildly. It was my day for memories; as he offered me the apothecary jar with the licorice whips in it, I suddenly remembered a radio program my mother and dad used to listen to when I was just a little kid: Mr. Keene, Tracer of Lost Persons. 'Sheriff was there that day, all right. He was s’posed to go bird-hunting, but he changed his mind damn quick when Lal Machen came in and told him that he was expecting Al Bradley that very afternoon.' 'How did Machen know that?' I asked. 'Well, that’s an instructive tale in itself,' Mr. Keene said, and the cynical smile creased his face again. 'Bradley wasn’t never Public Enemy Number One on the FBI’s hit parade, but they had wanted him—since 1928 or so. To show they could cut the mustard, I guess. Al Bradley and his brother George hit six or seven banks across the Midwest and then kidnapped a banker for ransom. The ransom was paid—thirty thousand dollars, a big sum for those days—but they killed the banker anyway. 'By then the Midwest had gotten a little toasty for the gangs that ran there, so Al and George and their litter of ratlings run northeast, up this way. They rented themselves a big farmhouse just over the town line in Newport, not far from where the Rhulin Farms are today."

There were eight of em—Al Bradley, George Bradley, Joe Conklin and his brother Cal, an Irishman named Arthur Malloy who was called ‘Creeping Jesus’ Malloy because he was nearsighted but wouldn’t put on his specs unless he absolutely had to, and Patrick Caudy, a young fellow from Chicago who was said to be kill-crazy but as handsome as Adonis. There were also two women with them: Kitty Donahue, George Bradley’s common-law wife, and Marie Hauser, who belonged to Caudy but sometimes got passed around, according to the stories we all heard later. 'They made one bad assumption when they got up here, sonny—they got the idea they were so far away from Indiana that they were safe. 'They laid low for awhile, and then got bored and decided they wanted to go hunting. They had plenty of firepower but they were a bit low on ammunition. So they all came into Derry on the seventh of October in two cars. Patrick Caudy took the women around shopping while the other men went into Machen’s Sporting Goods. Kitty Donahue bought a dress in Freese’s, and she died in it two days later. 'Lal Machen waited on the men himself. He died in 1959. Too fat, he was. Always too fat. But there wasn’t nothing wrong with his eyes, and he knew it was Al Bradley the minute he walked in, he said. He thought he recognized some of the others, but he wasn’t sure of Malloy until he put on his specs to look at a display of knives in a glass case. 'Al Bradley walked up to him and said, ‘We’d like to buy some ammunition.’ ‘Well,’ Lal Machen says, ‘you come to the right place.’ 'Bradley handed him a paper and Lal read it over. The paper has been lost, at least so far as I know, but Lal said it would have turned your blood cold. They wanted five hundred rounds of .38-caliber ammunition, eight hundred rounds of .45-caliber, sixty rounds of .50-caliber, which they don’t even make anymore, shotgun shells loaded both with buck and bird, and a thousand rounds each of .22 short- and long-rifle. Plus—get this—sixteen thousand rounds of .45 machine-gun bullets.' 'Holy shit!' I said. Mr. Keene smiled that cynical smile again and offered me the apothecary jar. At first I shook my head and then I took another whip."

                   "content": "' ‘This here is quite a shopping-list, boys,’ Lal says. ' ‘Come on, Al,’ Creeping Jesus Malloy says. ‘I told you we wasn’t going to get it in a hick town like this. Let’s go on up to Bangor. They won’t have nothing there either, but I can use a ride.’' ‘Now hold your horses,’ Lal says, just as cool as a cucumber. ‘This here is one hell of a good order and I wouldn’t want to lose it to that Jew up Bangor. I can give you the .22s right now, also the bird and half the buck. I can give you a hundred rounds each of the .38- and .45-caliber, too. I could have the rest for you . . . ’ And here Lal sort of half-closed his eyes and tapped his chin, as if calculating it out. ‘. . . by day after tomorrow. How’d that be?’ 'Bradley grinned like he’d split his head around the back and said it sounded just as fine as paint. Cal Conklin said he’d still like to go on up to Bangor, but he was outvoted. ‘Now, if you’re not sure you can make good on this order, you ought to say so right now,’ Al Bradley says to Lal, ‘because I’m a pretty fine fellow but when I get mad you don’t want to get into a pissing contest with me. You follow?’ ' ‘I do,’ Lal says, ‘and I’ll have all the ammo you could want, Mr.—?’ ' ‘Rader,’ Bradley says. ‘Richard D. Rader, at your service.’ 'He stuck out his hand and Lal pumped it, grinning all the while. ‘Real pleased, Mr. Rader.’ 'So then Bradley asked him what would be a good time for him and his friends to drop by and pick up the goods, and Lal Machen asked them right back how two in the afternoon sounded to them. They agreed that would be fine. Out they went. Lal watched them go. They met the two women and Caudy on the sidewalk outside. Lal recognized Caudy, too. 'So,' Mr. Keene said, looking at me bright-eyed, 'what do you think Lal done then? Called the cops?' 'I guess he didn’t,' I said, 'based on what happened. Me, I would have broken my leg getting to the telephone.' 'Well, maybe you would and maybe you wouldn’t,' Mr. Keene said with that same cynical, bright-eyed smile, and I shivered because I knew what he meant . . . and he knew I knew. Once something heavy begins to roll, it can’t be stopped; it’s simply going to roll until it finds a flat place long enough to wear away all of its forward motion. You can stand in front of that thing and get flattened . . . but that won’t stop it, either. 'Maybe you would have and maybe you wouldn’t,' Mr. Keene repeated. 'But I can tell you what Lal Machen did. The rest of that day and all of the next, when someone he knew came in—some man—why, he would tell them that he knew who had been out in the woods around the Newport-Derry line shooting at deer and grouse and God knows what else with Kansas City typewriters. It was the Bradley Gang. He knew for a fact because he had recognized em. He’d tell em that Bradley and his men were coming back the next day around two to pick up the rest of their order. He’d tell them he’d promised Bradley all the ammunition he could want, and that was a promise he intended to keep.' 'How many?' I asked. I felt hypnotized by his glittering eye. Suddenly the dry smell of this back room—the smell of prescription drugs and powders, of Musterole and Vicks VapoRub and Robitussin cough syrup—suddenly all those smells seemed suffocating . . . but I could no more have left than I could kill myself by holding my breath. 'How many men did Lal pass the word to?' Mr. Keene asked. I nodded. 'Don’t know for sure,' Mr. Keene said. 'Didn’t stand right there and take up sentry duty. All those he felt he could trust, I suppose.' 'Those he could trust,' I mused. My voice was a little hoarse. 'Ayuh,' Mr. Keene said. 'Derrymen, you know. Not that many of em raised cows.' He laughed at this old joke before going on. 'I came in around ten the day after the Bradleys first dropped in on Lal. He told me the story, then asked how he could help me. I’d only come in to see if my last roll of pictures had been developed—in those days Machen’s handled all the Kodak films and cameras—but after I got my photos I also said I could use some ammo for my Winchester. ' ‘You gonna shoot some game, Norb?’ Lal asks me, passing over the shells. ' ‘Might plug some varmints,’ I said, and we had us a chuckle over that.' Mr. Keene laughed and slapped his skinny leg as if this was still the best joke he had ever heard. He leaned forward and tapped my knee. 'All I mean, son, is that the story got around all it needed to. Small towns, you know. If you tell the right people, what you need to pass along will get along . . . see what I mean? Like another licorice whip?' I took one with numb fingers. 'Make you fat,' Mr. Keene said, and cackled. He looked old then . . . infinitely old, with his bifocals slipping down the gaunt blade of his nose and the skin stretched too tight and thin across his cheeks to wrinkle. 'The next day I brought my rifle into the store with me and Bob Tanner, who worked harder than any assistant I ever had after him, brought in his pop’s shotgun. Around eleven that day Gregory Cole came in for a bicarb of soda and damned if he didn’t have a Colt .45 jammed right in his belt."

                   "content": "On the day after Mike Hanlon made his calls, Henry Bowers began to hear voices. Voices had been talking to him all day long. For awhile, Henry thought they were coming from the moon. In the late afternoon, looking up from where he was hoeing in the garden, he could see the moon in the blue daytime sky, pale and small. A ghost-moon. That, in fact, was why he believed it was the moon that was talking to him. Only a ghost-moon would talk in ghost-voices—the voices of his old friends, and the voices of those little kids who had played down in the Barrens so long ago. Those, and another voice . . . one he did not dare name. Victor Criss spoke from the moon first. They comin back, Henry. All of em, man. They comin back to Derry. Then Belch Huggins spoke from the moon, perhaps from the dark side of the moon. You’re the only one, Henry. The only one of us left. You’ll have to get em for me and Vic. Ain’t no little kids can rank us out like that. Why, I hit a ball one time down to Tracker’s, and Tony Tracker said that ball would have been out of Yankee Stadium. He hoed, looking up at the ghost-moon in the sky, and after awhile Fogarty came over and hit him in the back of the neck and knocked him flat on his face. 'You’re hoein up the peas right along with the weeds, you ijit.' Henry got up, brushing dirt off his face and out of his hair. There stood Fogarty, a big man in a white jacket and white pants, his belly swelled out in front of him. It was illegal for the guards (who were called 'counsellors' here at Juniper Hill) to carry billyclubs, so a number of them—Fogarty, Adler, and Koontz were the worst—carried rolls of quarters in their pockets. They almost always hit you with them in the same place, right in the back of the neck. There was no rule against quarters. Quarters were not considered a deadly weapon at Juniper Hill, an institution for the mentally insane which stood on the outskirts of Augusta near the Sidney town line. 'I’m sorry, Mr. Fogarty,' Henry said, and offered a big grin which showed an irregular line of yellow teeth. They looked like the pickets in a fence outside a haunted house. Henry had begun to lose his teeth when he was fourteen or so. 'Yeah, you’re sorry,' Fogarty said. 'You’ll be a lot sorrier if I catch you doing it again, Henry.' 'Yes sir, Mr. Fogarty.' Fogarty walked away, his black shoes leaving big brown tracks in the dirt of West Garden. Because Fogarty’s back was turned, Henry took a moment to look around surreptitiously. They had been shooed out to hoe as soon as the clouds cleared, everyone from the Blue Ward—which was where they put you if you had once been very dangerous but were now considered only moderately dangerous. Actually, all the patients at Juniper Hill were considered moderately dangerous; it was a facility for the criminally insane. Henry Bowers was here because he had been convicted of killing his father in the late fall of 1958—it had been a famous year for murder trials, all right; when it came to murder trials, 1958 had been a pip. Only of course it wasn’t just his father they thought he had killed; if it had only been his father, Henry would not have spent twenty years in the Augusta State Mental Hospital, much of that time under physical and chemical restraint. No, not just his father; the authorities thought he had killed all of them, or at least most of them. Following the verdict the News had published a front-page editorial titled 'The End of Derry’s Long Night.' In it they had recapped the salient points: the belt in Henry’s bureau that belonged to the missing Patrick Hockstetter; the jumble of schoolbooks, some signed out to the missing Belch Huggins and some to the missing Victor Criss, both known chums of the Bowers boy, in Henry’s closet; most damning of all, the panties found tucked into a slit in Henry’s mattress, panties which had been identified by laundry-mark as having belonged to Veronica Grogan, deceased Henry Bowers, the News declared, had been the monster haunting Derry in the spring and summer of 1958. But then the News had proclaimed the end of Derry’s long night on the front page of its December 6th edition, and even an ijit like Henry knew that in Derry night never ended. They had bullied him with questions, had stood around him in a circle, had pointed fingers at him. Twice the Chief of Police had slapped him across the face and once a detective named Lottman had punched him in the gut, telling him to fess up, and be quick. 'There’s people outside and they ain’t happy, Henry,' this Lottman had said. 'There ain’t been a lynching in Derry for a long time, but that don’t mean there couldn’t be one.' He supposed they would have kept it up as long as necessary, not because any of them really believed the good Derryfolk were going to break into the police station, carry Henry out, and hang him from a sour-apple tree, but because they were desperate to close the books on that summer’s blood and horror; they would have, but Henry didn’t make them. They wanted him to confess to everything, he understood after awhile. Henry didn’t mind. After the horror in the sewers, after what had happened to Belch and Victor, he didn’t seem to mind about anything. Yes, he said, he had killed his father. This was true. Yes, he had killed Victor Criss and Belch Huggins. This was also true, at least in the sense that he had led them into the tunnels where they had been murdered. Yes, he had killed Patrick. Yes, Veronica. Yes one, yes all. Not true, but it didn’t matter. Blame needed to be taken. Perhaps that was why he had been spared. And if he refused . . . He understood about Patrick’s belt. He had won it from Patrick playing scat one day in April, discovered it didn’t fit, and tossed it in his bureau. He understood about the books, too—hell, the three of them chummed around together and they cared no more for their summer textbooks than they had for their regular ones, which is to say, they cared for them about as much as a woodchuck cares for tap-dancing. There were probably as many of his books in their closets, and the cops probably knew it, too. But he thought he knew who—or what—had taken care of it. Best not to talk about such things. Best to just dummy up. So they sent him to Augusta and finally, in 1979, they had transferred him to Juniper Hill, and he had only run into trouble once here and that was because at first no one understood. A guy had tried to turn off Henry’s nightlight. The nightlight was Donald Duck doffing his little sailor hat. Donald was protection after the sun went down. With no light, things could come in. The locks on the door and the wire mesh did not stop them. They came like mist. Things. They talked and laughed . . . and sometimes they clutched. Hairy things, smooth things, things with eyes. The sort of things that had really killed Vic and Belch when the three of them had chased the kids into the tunnels under Derry in August of 1958."
